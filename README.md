## PROGSU Guide on Referrals
Built by students, for students — powered by [PROGSU](https://progsu.com), Georgia State’s tech club for builders, coders, and creators.
### _Prerequisites: Polished Referall + Linkedin_
# THe Holy Guide to Referrals
So you've got a killer resume. Your Linkedin is a virtual shrine (with a little embelishing) to your potential.
But still... no interviews. What gives?

## Why Referrals Matter
You might hear that referrals don't really matter. This may be partially true for some companies.
But when someone inside a company vouches for you through the various methods we'll talk about (submitting your resume, sending your info, or just dropping your name) It's not just a polite gesture. It's **a multiplier**.

> **Stat Check:** Referred candidates are **4x more likely** to get hired compared to cold applicants.

Your referrals turns your cold application into a warm handshake (warm app). And hiring managers? They like warm.

## Types of Referrals

Important note: Not all referrals are created equal. Here's the rundown:

### 1. **System Referrals**
   - Submitted into the company’s internal portal
   - Might have an option/requirement to fill out a note, questions about you, and/or a resume

### 2. **Referral Links / Codes**
   - Special links that tag your application
   - Early access links
   - Common for smaller startups or internships

### 3. **Hiring Manager / Recruiter Email**
   - Best case scenario
   - Bypasses the portal entirely
   - Human sees your resume, not the algorithm (ATS)
   - You're basically cutting the line at Chick-Fil-A

## Strategy: From Stranger to Referral

Make sure that you have a good linkedin and resume first!


### Step 1: **Grow Your Network (Cold Outreach on LinkedIn)**
This is gonna require Linkedin Premium
- Send 100+ custom connection requests/notes per week. Linkedin has a weekly cap or they might flag/ban you
- Target: employees at companies you want to work at **10-20 connection requests per company**
  - Find a company for today (example google) and search on linkedin "Google Software Engineers"
- Use filters: alumni, similar age, ethnicity, role
- Custom Message Formula: Your going to want to change this to be more personalized (detailed examples in future)
  > "Hey [Name], I’m a [School] student interested in [Company]. Saw your path and would love to connect!"
  > "Hey [Name], I’m majoring in [major] at [School (if they're alumni)]. I saw you were at [Company] and hoping to learn from someone ahead of me in their journey"


### Step 2: **Set Up the Call (Informational Interview)**

Once they accept, ask for a 15–20 min chat. This isn’t just to “pick their brain.” It’s to:

- Learn about the company, team, and values
- Understand how they got in
- Ask about timelines, interview prep, and advice
- Build rapport

Pro-Tip: Set up a calendly. You can link your calendar, and make it as easy as possible for them to schedule something with you 

> 🧠 Psychology Hack: People are more likely to help once they’ve spent time talking with you.

Next Pop the big question:
- "It's so crazy out there now. Would you be okay with referring me to position/listing? I just want to make sure my application at least gets seen"

## Objection Handling: What If They Say No?

Some common excuses — and your counterplays:

- **"Referrals don’t do much at my company"**  
  > "Totally get that — even if it doesn’t make a huge difference, I figured it can’t hurt. Would you mind submitting one anyway?"

- **"I’m not sure how to refer"**  
  > "No worries — do you know who I should ask? Or when you might be able to find out?"

- **"We only refer people we’ve worked with"**  
  > "Absolutely makes sense. Would it be okay to connect me with someone else who’s hired interns/new grads before?"

     
## 🔁 The Fortune Is in the Follow-Up

Referrals are rarely a one-and-done.

- Follow up if they ghost (assume they forgot, not that they said no)
- Follow up weekly or biweekly
- Use polite, grateful language
- Follow up *after applying*, too:
  > “Hi [Recruiter Name], I just applied to the [Role] and wanted to reach out directly and express my excitement. I’d love to connect and chat more if possible!”

## Additional Tactics to Supercharge Your Referral Game

### Get More Than Just the Referral

During the call, always ask:

- “Would you be open to connecting me with your recruiter or hiring manager?”
- “Do you know anyone else on the team I could talk to?”

Stack those connections like LEGO bricks. Each new person = more exposure.

### Use Chat if Needed

Sometimes they’ll prefer answering over LinkedIn chat instead of hopping on a call. That’s fine — here’s your mini script:

> “Totally understand! My main questions are:
> 1. What was the interview/application process like for [Role]?
> 2. If it opens, would you be able to refer me? I know these roles are super competitive and just want to give myself the best shot.”


## ⏱️ Timing Is Everything

Don’t blindly hit “Apply” without a referral plan.

| Company Prestige | Wait Time Before Applying Without Referral |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| FAANG            | 24–48 hours                                |
| Mid-Tier         | 2–4 days                                   |
| Smaller Startups | 5–7 days                                   |

Still apply if you’ve waited too long — but try to get that referral first.

## 🧾 What to Send When They Agree to Refer

Be a referral pro. Send this package:

- PDF resume
- Role you're applying to
- Any application links if available
- Your contact info (email + phone) + Ask them if linkedin is the best way to reach them (ask for other contact info)

Bonus: Create a Google Doc template they can use to copy/paste into the referral form.

## 🛠️ Referral Success Rates (If You Stick to the System)

| Action                 | Success Rate |
|------------------------|--------------|
| Connection Request     | 15–20%       |
| Getting on a Call      | 20–30%       |
| Asking for Referral    | 80–90%       |

This is why it works. Most people never even ask.

## 💡 The Mentality

Referrals aren’t a one-time play. You’re not digging for gold, you’re casting a web. Week after week. Company after company.

Be patient. Be consistent. Be relentless.

Your future job offer isn’t waiting on a job board. It’s waiting in someone’s inbox, you just haven’t asked yet.
